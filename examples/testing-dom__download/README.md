# Download and validate a file

![File download in Chrome](images/chrome.png)

See [cypress/plugins/index.js](cypress/plugins/index.js) to see how we set the browser preferences to se the download folder and bypass the download modal dialog. See the [cypress/integration/spec.js](cypress/integration/spec.js) spec file that downloads and verifies:
- a CSV file
- an Excel file
- a PNG image
- a TXT file
- a JS file
- a Zip file


Text files are validated right from the browser spec, but the binary files like the downloaded Zip archives need to be validated from Node code using the plugins file.
